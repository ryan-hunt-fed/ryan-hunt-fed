### Hi there 


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently Studying 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Web Development to become a front end developer and seeing how that goes either stick with it or transition to a designer rather than a developer. I would also like to look into game devlopment as I would like to make my own games at some point too.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: r-g-hunt@hotmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am also a 3D Modeler and 3D Animator (Though it's been a while since I've done animation) and I hope one day to set up a buisness to either make and sell my own miniatures or to make my own games or game assets.

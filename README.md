<h1 align="center" style="border-bottom: none"> Ryan Hunt </h1>
<h2 align="center"> Frontend Web Developer || 3D artist </h2>


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently looking for work or Internships/Graduate programs as a Frontend Web Developer with a UI focus, as that is the area I seem to enjoy the most. I am not currently looking but I am also open to 3D modelling interships, whether they be character or environment focused.  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning any areas I can get my hands on when it comes to areas that interest me, currently being frontend development and UI. I'm always eager to learn and improve all my skills so I can get to a point of acomplishment with the certain skills.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am also a trained 3D Modeler and 3D Animator, through previous study at Yoobee College of Creative Innovation and my own learning. While I am open to trying to get into the Games industry, I hope one day, as part of my own asperations, to set up a buisness to either make and sell my own miniatures or to make my own games or game assets.
